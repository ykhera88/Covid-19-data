# Covid-19-data - Summary of the project
Part 1:

Create a Shiny app using RStudio. Load the supplied comma separated variables (csv) file and use Shiny to:

    Summarise and visualise the data and perform Exploratory Data Analysis. Make good use of controls.

    From this evidence and the supplied background develop a strategy to deal with missing values.

    From this evidence and the supplied background develop a strategy to deal with outliers.

    Develop a pre-processing strategy for things like centering and scaling.

    Implement these strategies using a “recipes” based data processing pipeline.

    Develop a tuned glmnet model and visualise its test performance. Document the model’s optimal hyperparameters.

    Identify any residual outliers.

The submission should be a set of files: ui.R, server.R and global.R that I should be able to run and grade.


Part2:

Write a report on your modelling. Include appropriate images from your shiny app.

    Discuss the data and any curious features that you noticed. Record the issues you would have followed up with a domain expert, were one available.

    Document your various strategies using words (rather than code).

    Research glmnet method and explain the method in your report.

    Document your glmnet model’s theoretical performance on unseen data.

Submit your report as a PDF.
